              Kaleidoscope was born from a personal truth. After decades of insider experience with failed treatment and hollow promises, our founder recognized what most refuse to admit: Alcoholism is not a disease, it's a conditioned response to pain and trauma. Even immense pain and trauma can be extinguished; then, we help you reclaim your life. We only work with people who are truly ready â€” those who are willing to do whatever it takes to stop drinking and start living. And, we never let go.
